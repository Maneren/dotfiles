# dotfiles
my simple collection of dotfiles for zsh and bash (not actively used, just a backup of old files)

desktop version is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 on WSL2 and  
mobile on Ubuntu 20.04 on Termux on Samsung Tab 5e

## Install
install script adds symlinks into ~ pointing to files and folders in this repo  
(direct subfolders are just for structure, they are ignored by the install script)

## Direct dependencies:
 - zsh, oh-my-zsh
 - zsh-syntax-highlighting
 - powerline-go
 - fzf
